FEMTO-WINDOW SCHEDULER: FINAL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS REPORT
==========================================================
Dataset Analysis: 6 Simulation Runs (10 to 400 Processes)
Analysis Baseline: Maximum System Load (400 Processes)

1. EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS (Overhead Reduction)
   vs Round Robin (Q=5):
   - RR(Q=5) Context Switches: 32299
   - Femto Context Switches:   6682
   -------------------------------------------------------
   >>> RESULT: Femto reduced system overhead by 79.31%
   
2. RESPONSIVENESS ANALYSIS (User Experience)
   vs Round Robin (Q=20):
   - RR(Q=20) Avg Response:    2912.6 ticks
   - Femto Avg Response:       1104.4 ticks
   -------------------------------------------------------
   >>> RESULT: Femto is 62.08% faster to respond than RR(20).

3. THEORETICAL OPTIMALITY
   vs SRTF (Preemptive Shortest Job First - "God Mode"):
   - SRTF Avg Wait Time:       88479.8 ticks
   - Femto Avg Wait Time:      125240.1 ticks
   -------------------------------------------------------
   >>> RESULT: Femto is within 41.55% of the theoretical limit
               without knowing burst times in advance.

4. SCALABILITY CONCLUSION
   Under heavy load, Femto-Window successfully identifies 'Stable' 
   processes and scales the Time Quantum, avoiding the thrashing 
   seen in RR(Q=5) while maintaining the interactivity missing 
   in RR(Q=20).
